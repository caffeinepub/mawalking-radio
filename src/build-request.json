        "On both the Mini Player and Now Playing screen, long track titles still scroll right-to-left only when they overflow their container.",
        "The marquee scroll speed is noticeably slightly slower than the current default (no sudden jumps, no stutter).",
        "There is a small, perceptible pause at the repeat point (loop boundary) so the motion feels calmer, without breaking the seamless duplicate-text marquee effect.",
        "The existing pause/resume interactions (pointer down/up, keyboard focus + Space/Enter) continue to work as before.",
        "If the OS/browser has prefers-reduced-motion enabled, the title does not animate (same as current behavior)."

  "constraints": [
    "Do not modify any files under frontend/src/components/ui or other frontend immutablePaths.",
    "Keep the marquee right-to-left direction and keep reduced-motion behavior and accessibility interactions intact."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Do not change backend behavior or data models.",
    "Do not redesign the Mini Player or Now Playing layouts beyond the marquee motion tuning."
