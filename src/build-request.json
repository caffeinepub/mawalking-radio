      "text": "Update the global CSS background positioning so the current background image is shifted 2 inches downward and 3 inches to the left on both mobile and desktop breakpoints. Implement this by adjusting the `background-position` values in `frontend/src/index.css` for the `body` rule (mobile default) and the `@media (min-width: 768px) { body { ... } }` rule (desktop), while keeping `background-size: cover` and all existing background asset references unchanged.",
