        "The default `speedPxPerSecond` value in `frontend/src/components/player/TrackTitleMarquee.tsx` is reduced from the current value (200) to a slower value.",
        "In both the Mini Player (`frontend/src/components/player/MiniPlayer.tsx`) and Now Playing screen (`frontend/src/screens/NowPlayingScreen.tsx`), the visible marquee scrolls right-to-left at the new slower speed without requiring any prop changes where `TrackTitleMarquee` is used.",
        "The computed marquee animation duration increases accordingly (duration is derived from distance / speed), and remains clamped within the existing 3–30 seconds bounds in `frontend/src/hooks/useMarqueeMeasurements.ts`.",
        "Reduced-motion behavior and pause-on-interaction behavior continue to work as before (no regression)."
