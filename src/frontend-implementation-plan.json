        "When a long track title overflows, the marquee scrolls right-to-left at the updated speed (visibly different from the previous speed).",

        "Reduced-motion preference still disables the marquee animation.",
        "The marquee continues to calculate duration from `totalDistance / speedPxPerSecond` and stays within the existing duration clamp (3s–30s)."
