      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "`frontend/src/index.css` no longer uses `background-size: contain` for the `body` background and instead uses `background-size: 100% auto` and/or `background-size: auto 100%` as the applied value(s).",
        "The background image remains not tiled (`background-repeat: no-repeat`) and continues to use the existing image-set asset URLs.",
        "The app builds successfully and the background renders without obvious cropping introduced by the chosen sizing mode on both mobile and desktop breakpoints."

          "description": "Update the `body` background sizing rule by replacing `background-size: contain;` with `background-size: 100% auto;` (or `background-size: auto 100%;`) to evaluate improved alignment/visibility. Keep existing `background-image` (including the current `image-set` URLs), `background-repeat: no-repeat`, and current `background-position` unless adjustment is required to accommodate the new sizing behavior. Do not change any referenced background asset filenames/paths."
