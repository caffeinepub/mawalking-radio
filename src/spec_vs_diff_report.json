  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented in frontend/src/index.css by switching the body background to background-size: contain with background-repeat: no-repeat and setting background-position to center center for both mobile and desktop. However, the diff also introduces several additional global styling/layout changes not requested and potentially outside the stated non-goals.",
