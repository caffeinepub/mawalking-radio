  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by updating `body` background-position for both the default (mobile) rule and the `@media (min-width: 768px)` (desktop) rule in `frontend/src/index.css`, shifting 3in left and 2in down while keeping `background-size: cover` and leaving the referenced background asset paths unchanged. Two additional non-requested files were also modified.",
