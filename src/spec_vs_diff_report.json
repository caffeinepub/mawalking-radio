REQ-1 is only partially evidenced: SettingsAboutScreen cache deletion was updated to the new filename, but the diff provides no evidence that the new image asset was added or that App.tsx and the service worker were updated to reference/special-case the new background everywhere required.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Generate a new, smaller version of the current global background image (5x smaller) and update the app to reference it everywhere the old background was used (App.tsx backgroundImage, SettingsAboutScreen cache clear, and service-worker special-casing).",
      "reason": "No new image file was added under frontend/public/assets/generated/ (diff shows no added files), and the provided App.tsx and service-worker.js snippets are truncated and do not show the required background filename references/special-casing. Only SettingsAboutScreen clearly references the new filename.",

      "reason": "These changes are described in frontend-file-summaries.txt but are not part of the BuildRequest’s goals (which only asked for background asset shrink/reference updates, Home label styling, and Play button prominence) and are not corroborated by the listed set of modified code files (7 total).",
