  "summary": "HomeLiveScreen.tsx was updated to add an explicit initial play state and apply a larger, black, circular Play/Pause button styling when not playing and not connecting. Two additional files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json) were modified with changes unrelated to the requested UI tweak.",

      "requirement": "The Play icon inside the button scales appropriately with the new larger button size (no clipping/misalignment).",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated before the Play icon render branch, so it does not show what size/classes are applied to the Play icon specifically in the initial (not playing) state.",
