  "summary": "REQ-1 appears partially addressed via CSS changes intended to enforce deterministic RTL marquee behavior, but the diff evidence does not show prefers-reduced-motion handling. REQ-2’s cache-refresh aspect is implemented via a service worker cache version bump and explicit background asset caching, but there is no evidence that the actual mobile background image files were cropped/updated.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "When the user has `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, the text does not animate and remains readable.",
      "reason": "The provided `frontend/src/index.css` diff excerpt does not show any `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` (or equivalent) rules disabling marquee animation; the file is truncated and no other file shown contains this handling.",

        "frontend/src/index.css (truncated)"

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Crop/adjust the existing mobile background image assets (PNG/WebP/AVIF) while keeping the same filenames and dimensions.",
      "reason": "No image/binary assets are included in the diff summary (only 4 text files modified). The changes shown are CSS background positioning and service worker caching, not actual asset re-cropping.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: Added 0, Modified 4 (no assets under /assets/generated shown)",
        "frontend/src/index.css (uses existing filenames but does not modify assets)"

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Service worker expanded to cache icons and background assets on install using individual fetch+cache.put with `cache: 'reload'`, plus aggressive deletion of all old caches and runtime cache naming.",
      "reason": "REQ-2 only asks that updated mobile background assets are served after reload for PWA users (cache refreshed/invalidated). The diff shows broader caching behavior beyond that requirement.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/public/service-worker.js (CACHE_VERSION/CACHE_NAME/RUNTIME_CACHE, ICON_ASSETS, BACKGROUND_ASSETS, install caching logic, activate cache deletion)"
