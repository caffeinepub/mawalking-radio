  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by updating the default marquee speed (`speedPxPerSecond`) and keeping right-to-left duration calculation (`totalDistance / speedPxPerSecond`) with the existing 3s–30s clamp, while still disabling animation under reduced-motion. However, the diff also adds several interaction behaviors and metadata updates that were not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Added pause/resume interaction logic for the marquee (pointer down/up/leave/cancel, focus/blur, keyboard toggling with Space/Enter, and global pointer event handling).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to adjust marquee speed while keeping RTL direction and existing reduced-motion/clamp behaviors; no new interaction behavior was requested.",
