  "summary": "REQ-2 and REQ-3 appear implemented: index.css now uses mawalking-user-bg* responsive image-set backgrounds with overlay, and both service-worker.js and SettingsAboutScreen.tsx reference/clear the same new background asset filenames. However, REQ-1 is not fully met because the diff shows no new static asset files added under frontend/public/assets/generated (the required mawalking-user-bg* image files are referenced but not added). Some extra, unrequested changes were also made (build verification script and project metadata updates).",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add the uploaded image to frontend static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated (original filename or stable renamed variant) and commit/serve it so it renders as the global background.",
      "reason": "The implementation references new background asset filenames in CSS/service worker/settings, but the diff shows no added files at all, so the required images themselves are not present/committed under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"Added: 0\" (no new assets added)",
        "frontend/src/index.css (references /assets/generated/mawalking-user-bg-mobile.dim_1080x1920.* and /assets/generated/mawalking-user-bg.dim_1920x1080.*)",

    {
      "description": "Added/modified a frontend build verification script that checks for background asset paths, NodeJS.Timeout usage, and service worker configuration.",
