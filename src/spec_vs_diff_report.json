  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented in `frontend/src/index.css` by changing the `body` background sizing from `contain` to `background-size: 100% auto` while keeping `background-repeat: no-repeat` and using `image-set` URLs for the background images. However, the diff also introduces several additional, unrequested changes (overlay, fixed attachment, full-viewport layout rules) and modifies unrelated project metadata/summary files.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced a full-viewport background/layout system (html/body width/height/min-height/overflow rules) beyond the requested background-size change.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to adjust `background-size` (and keep existing repeat/position/assets unless required). The added layout/viewport rules are not requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css"

    },
    {
      "description": "Added a dark transparency overlay via `body::before` (35% opacity) and z-index layering for `#root`.",
      "reason": "Non-goals include adding user-facing controls; while this overlay is not a control, it is still a significant visual feature not requested as part of adjusting background-size.",

        "frontend/src/index.css"

    },
    {
      "description": "Modified `frontend-file-summaries.txt` with extensive feature descriptions unrelated to the requested CSS change.",

    {
      "description": "Modified `project_state.json` (project tracking entries AR-1/AR-2) unrelated to implementing the CSS requirement.",
