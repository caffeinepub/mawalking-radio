  "summary": "Changes adjust TrackTitleMarquee behavior (configurable speed, reduced-motion detection, pause/resume interactions) and marquee measurement calculations; index.css is modified but the provided truncation does not show the marquee keyframes needed to verify the requested loop-boundary pause/slower feel. Two meta/documentation files (frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json) were also updated with unrelated feature summaries/requests.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Adjust the right-to-left track title marquee motion so it feels slightly less aggressive: make the default scroll a bit slower and introduce a subtle pause at the loop boundary (end/start) while keeping the scroll itself smooth and continuous during movement.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a default speedPxPerSecond value (80) and duration computation, but provides no baseline for comparison to prove it is 'slightly slower', and the truncated CSS does not include (or allow verification of) keyframes/animation changes that create a perceptible pause at the loop boundary while maintaining seamless duplicate-text scrolling.",

    {
      "description": "Added/updated repository meta summaries and feature-tracking entries unrelated to marquee tuning (e.g., describing changes to App.tsx, PWA/service worker, notifications, Tailwind breakpoint, request form, install prompt, etc.).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest scope is limited to tuning marquee motion; updating summary/tracking files to describe broad unrelated features is not requested, and the diff evidence for those features exists only as narrative in these meta files.",
