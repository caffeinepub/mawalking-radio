Add a dedicated \"user intent\" state (e.g., userWantsToPlay) that is set to true only when the user initiates play and set to false when the user pauses (including sleep-timer-triggered pauses), and use it to prevent any auto-resume/auto-reconnect logic from restarting playback after an intentional pause.",
